I recently purchased a Skybag for my travels and I must say, I am extremely impressed with its performance and quality.Firstly, the design of the bag is sleek and stylish. The color options available are vibrant and eye-catching, making it easy to spot my bag on the luggage carousel. The material used is durable and seems to be able to withstand rough handling during travel.One of the standout features of the Skybag is its spaciousness. The bag has ample room to fit all my essentials and more. The main compartment is roomy and can easily accommodate clothes, shoes, toiletries, and even a few extra items. Additionally, the bag has multiple pockets and compartments, allowing for easy organization of smaller items such as documents, chargers, and personal belongings.Another aspect that impressed me was the bag's comfort. The padded shoulder straps and back support make it easy to carry, even when it is fully loaded. The straps are adjustable, ensuring a comfortable fit for individuals of different heights. This is especially important when navigating through airports or crowded areas.Furthermore, the bag's durability is exceptional. Despite being tossed around during flights and bus rides, the Skybag showed no signs of wear and tear. The zippers are sturdy and smooth, ensuring easy access to my belongings without any fear of them getting damaged or lost.Lastly, the Skybag offers great value for money. Considering its high quality and durability, the price point is reasonable and affordable. It is clear that the brand prioritizes customer satisfaction by providing a reliable and long-lasting product.Overall, I highly recommend the Skybag for anyone in need of a reliable and stylish travel companion. Its spaciousness, comfort, durability, and value for money make it an excellent choice for frequent travelers or even occasional holidaymakers.

One of the standout features of the Sky Bag is its ample storage capacity. The various compartments and pockets allow for easy organization of my belongings. I particularly appreciate the dedicated laptop sleeve, which provides extra protection for my tech gadgets. Moreover, the multiple external pockets are incredibly handy for storing items I need quick access to, such as my passport, water bottle, and snacks.

I bought this bag for my son. I was little confused because this was my first purchase of this seller. The bag quality is awesome. There are so many zipped compartments that you can keep all the things separately. My son loved the rain cover which is there in the bag. All in all it is a fantastic bag. The size is also perfect for kids of grade 2 and above. Complete value for money.

But too big for a 6 year old kid‚Ä¶nice deign and material
"

Overall its good product considering the cost. I'm expecting like, it can withstand 1 year at least for my son. This is sufficient for his class 3. If it would have been bit lesser price, would have reached the 5* for sure.

the design is colourful and suitable for children. It is spacious and pretty sturdy. If only the material was a little thicker and strong we would love to give it a 5 star. However it is a good bag for daily use and has many pockets and padded strap that makes carrying comfortable. The checks look great.

The bag is realllllly small as it was delivered I was shocked to see the size of the bag.. But anyways the design is really cool ans can be used as a picnic bag hence did not return..

The bag was a great buy as it helps me get all my school stuff organised and it has net compartments for other smaller stuff like my pen pouch and colour box with my water bottle qnd tiffin also that comes in.

The bag is really big and good, you can got a lot of books, it is light weight, but the problem is, it's not water resistant, my books often get wet when it rains, so suggest you to think before buying.

Trust me it's not worth the price. It's a very light bag. Probably suitable for someone who doesn't carry a lot of books (basically not ideal for students). Apart from that, there were threads coming out so the quality wasn't up to the mark. It looked good but I still returned it because it didn't serve the purpose anyhow.

I recently purchased this college bag, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! This bag has exceeded my expectations in every way.Firstly, the design is sleek and stylish, making it the perfect accessory for any college student. The color options are trendy, and the overall look is very modern.Secondly, the durability of this bag is impressive. It can carry all my textbooks, notebooks, and even my laptop without any strain. The zippers and stitching are of high quality, assuring me that this bag will last throughout my college years.Thirdly, the organization is fantastic. There are plenty of pockets and compartments to keep everything in its place. It's so easy to find what I need without rummaging through a mess.Fourthly, the comfort factor is not to be overlooked. The padded shoulder straps make carrying heavy loads a breeze, and the back panel is well-padded for extra comfort during long days on campus.Lastly, the price point is very reasonable for the quality you receive. I can confidently say that this college bag is worth every penny.Overall, I highly recommend this college bag to any student. It's stylish, durable, well-organized, comfortable, and reasonably priced. It has made my college life so much easier, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase! 5 stars without a doubt!

The review is after 3 or 4 months. The product is of good quality. There is no breaking of stitching and color is also intact.Surely one can go for this if looking a bag for the child.

This bag was really good when it arrived and I honestly liked it but as time went on I noticed that the sticker on the bag was already peeling off as shown in the video but later on there was a hole too at the top (visible in the pic) and it's just tearing apart now. It's only been about 1 month since I buyed it. Really not satisfied.

Quality is not good and did not expect this from VIP industries. Purchased it on Aug 2nd 2023 and not even a month the fabric torn near the zip line. Claimed warranty in the store and they are offering it to stich and I'm not i terested. My son won't take it to school anymore and this will go waste for me. This claiming warranty is painful as I had to go 18kms to the shop to deposit  and to have to go again to collect it.
"

Material Quality is good and zip lock Quality also good.

Worth the money, good material and good finish. switches are also good, it hold and handles almost 10kg weight books and notes.

The bag is good, it‚Äôs features are like any other branded bag that costs less than ‚Çπ800/- or so. In that sense it is overpriced by at least 20%. The material is thin, only with use can it be commented whether it‚Äôs sturdy. The shoulder straps are comfortable. There is no reinforcement at the bottom though it accommodates a rain cover in a neatly slotted space. If one likes the digital camo colour then one can go for it, else look for something else at lesser price.

Bought this bag for my son and another brand bag for my other son. This bag didnt even survive a month and got torn. This bag is not durable at all. Total money waste.
"
595,"
Pros1. It's spacious, 3 compartments,padded shoulder straps.2.Zippers are durable3. Rain cover4. Bottle pockets on one side5. The partitions inside are durable, atleast better than local products.6. It's cheaper- with same features a branded product from a company of repute will cost 1500-2000, this one costs less than 800 INR.Cons1. The pixelated design is mundane. A sober color/pattern would be much appreciated.2. It's a 30 litre bag, so four compartments,bottle pockets on both sides are preferable.3. The top grab handle/loop needs to be padded and sturdy. It's not- so runs the risk of tear if hung from hook while carrying some heavyduty content.Fix the issues and raise the price by 70-100 INR if needed. That's my suggestion. It will be still less than 900 bucks.

Best Backpack I've ever had so far. Been using this bag for 5 years. I recommend and bought a new one for my friend also.
"
623,"
The bag quality is good but not a little bit comfortable to carry also the belt of the bag rubs a little near the shoulder but I think it's new so may be the belt is rubs near the shoulder. Overall it's good backpack. You can buy it. Backpack is good for school and College students and also good for travel to 9-10 days camp.
"

Please try to deleiver in the day itself .........Other than the product is in good condition

This is my second purchase of fgear bag. It doesn't worth of 900rs ,even though I got it on sale.Quality is not as expected.
"

My bag was delivered today and the design is really good the material is also goodThe bag's colour is also very durableThe only thing u need to worry about is the logo of f gear which can come out if u snatch itThe size is also good for students studying in 8-12 u can also use it for traveling there is very much space for 2-4 sets of clothesIn the above image it looks blue but it's lite greenOver all its value for money
"
631,"
Excellent
"
632,"
I order the bag for my office use and i fits it but as there is no dedicated slot for laptop which make me little disappointed but the organizer is perfect and quality of the bag is also good but if you are buying it traveling for 5-4days i will not recommend this as it can hold with 3 shirts and 2 pants so plan according to it
"
633,"
I really like it.. Bag have water resistant.. material was too good.. but bags inside material was very lite.. otherwise it's good for office use and travel

I'm giving this review after using for 3months It can be used by college students as well as for travelling but for school students it can't bear more weight
"
637,"
Large volume bag.EconomicSeems great qualityBut don't compare it to Nike or Branded bagsRain cover is also great
"
638,"
One of the best from Gear. Light weight, perfect size. Not too small or too large.Can be used for travelling, office use.If you want a bag with no.of small compartments go for it.
"
639,"
No support on bottom, so you can't push more luggage than the bag capacity.No padded support in the bag.
"
640,"
Satisfied with the quality
"
641,"
It is really perfect to purchase. I have not used it in rain but bag rain cover is provided with it. I think it will help to protect from rain.
"
642,"
If I hang my bag have a folding on center part of bagthat's only issue that's looking not good
"
643,"
Good
"
644,"
Firstly, with the first look I was disappointed, as the color of the bag is not the same as was shown on the Amazon portal. I didn't want this color, its very light and sort of faded,  whereas the color shown in amazon was little dark and of my choice which I really liked.Otherwise the bag seems to be value for money, although I havnot used it so far since I received five days ago.So for showing a different color I will give only one star, otherwise 2 and half stars for overall.So my advice to the sales team of Amazon to not to deceive people with wrong description/ visuals.If you follow right ethics , things will be brighter. Please don't delete my review, put it into review portal so that custome make a right choice. Let me also put it that I am great supporter of Amazon and has done lots of shopping, but than such things disappoints.Thank you
"
645,"
I recommend to have one
"

Its very good backpack for college students. Rain Cover's material is nice. If you're looking for a bag for college or travel this backpack is for you. Inner material of bag is very nice with good stitches. Under 1000rs this thing right here is far better than any other product in market so grab it ...!

Good for price. But no laptop holder inside the compartment. Seems thin layered material. But worth for money as I bought it for 600/- change.

We have ordered the bag and used it for 7 days only and the stitching quality is very port of the bag. In just a week time the bag stitching started coming out. There is no option of replacement in this bag. Do not suggest to buy this.
"
661,"
This bag is quite costly at price of 1090.Many brands such as skybags American tourister is available in this range.Chaining pattern I hated.Hooks of shoulder adjuster also is down sight of this bag but overall it's nice .You will be affordable if you get available this bag n price of 700-800 you don't go for this bag if price range is 1000-1100.
"

It is a decent product. Just that it's priced a little high.

The material quality of this product is genuinely commendable. From the exterior to the internal components, there's a tangible sense of durability and craftsmanship. The choice of materials not only contributes to a sleek and modern design but also suggests longevity.The space allocation in this product is simply impressive. Every nook and cranny seems to be utilized efficiently, providing ample room for storage or usage.  The thoughtful organization of space adds to the product's overall user-friendliness.

Can be used for both traveller and students. 15inch laptop easily fit but as from bottom laptop is not secured bcz of very thin material & no cushion provided at bottom in laptop section though the material of backpack is sturdy. Spacious enough for 2-3 days travel for any gender but can't be protected against heavy rainfall. Have to buy rain cover separately. Neither Colour nor design fades easily. I'm using it for 3 yrs & washed it too with soft liquid detergent (ezee). Won't advice to keep lunch box without any protection in the backpack. In case of spillage the design between the 2 at the bottom of 2 section from inside have 2 opening like hole to provide strength for the backpack which will easily let the spillage to reach other section too. Rain cover must be of above 35lit. Below it will let the rain cover to slip from the backpack.Edit: one of the shoulder strap was about to tear of still for 6 month it didn't came out totally so i sent it to repair. My bag was collected from one of the Wildcraft outlet and sent to Bangalore. After keeping it for a month i received a reply that it couldn't be repaired as the fabric isn't available for this production of bag. Instead they are providing me voucher equivalent to my bag's original price. But if u want to receive ur bag as it is then u have to give up voucher. It's due to audit system. It's logical but it's harsh too as i bought this bag with whole heart and now I'm given a choice.üò¢

Stitching is good .Space is sufficient as shown .I used it for 10 months .no zip damage .The print is long lasting .The handles have thick cushions.Mesh behind the bag front side causing less pain on the back.the hanging length is adjustable like any other bag .2 hangers to hang to any type of hook sizes .You can carry the bag with one hand as seen in pic.Not a waterproof but splashes can be resisted.buy bag cover for travel needs.

It's a fake Wildcraft product. When you try to scan the QR code provided to avail warranty, it won't work.
"

Material is very soft. Zipper is struck at corners.
"
987,"
The bag is very spacious. Material is light weight, water proof and durable. Design is classy. No fading of colours from constant use.I have been using it on regular basis for my work purpose for the last two months And I am quite satisfied with it except for the water bottle compartment. Even a 1 L bottle doesn‚Äôt fit well in it, Cause if you bend down like - to tie your shoes or pick up something that you have dropped from the ground - with the bag on and a bottle in the water bottle compartment, it is sure to fall.

Nice i like it but space is less

Bag was great . It‚Äôs genuine product.  I bought it at 1500.  I have seen most of the time during special days like festival or sales the price will be around 1000rs .

Wild wild craft...crafted wildely...made me go a bit wild :-D Was disappointed with this bag. But then it was a bad choice from my side I guess. That is what one would get from Wildcraft for that price. And this was not a laptop bag which the description said. The tag on the bag said  ""School Bag"" Well, I always loved Wildcraft and I went ahead and bought a more upmarket model and am in love with it :-)
"
998,"
I use this bag for college and it‚Äôs been working pretty good so far. Only problem is it ain‚Äôt got any extra compartments to keep extra stuff like earphones or pens. Overall build quality is good
"

Had bought the blue color bag for my older son and seeing convenience and quality made me order the black one for my younger son.3 compartments and multiple other pockets makes it very easy to organize items in the bags.Very light weight, big size which can accommodate text books, notebooks, lunch and snack boxes of a 6th and 10th standard child very easily. Water repellent material means no more seepage of water and having to carry the books inside a plastic cover.
"
1000,"
Very small in size pls without physical verify do not buy.
"

Quality of zip is pathetic and it malfunctions

This product is very nice... It's really a worthy commodity for money... Wild craft is giving 5 year assurance guarantee on this product... I am really satisfied with this bag.. Thank you Amazon and Wild craft...
"

On some reviews, it was mentioned as water resistant but after using it in first rain fall, it proved that documents in all 3 compartments get wet which made me know that it is not at all water resistant. Not expected it for Wildcraft product. When we buy it as laptop bag then it is expected to be well enought to protect the laptop from water but it is total failure. Very much disappointed with the quality. Felt deceived in name of brand. I will not recommend it to buy at 2k cost.
"
1005,"
Bag quality is good and light weight but in big size chain not close properly at my end some time it is create problem.I will recommend this, you can buy this product.

Extremely lightweight...I repeat extremely lightweight and small looking yet carries a lot of things in it.. not entirely waterproof, sometimes when it's raining my documents in 1st chain gets a little wet, not entirely.

I recently purchased a laptop bag from Amazon, and I am extremely disappointed with the poor quality. The bag features a fake brand logo, and the overall construction is subpar. The materials used are flimsy, and the stitching is uneven. The zippers are prone to jamming, making it a frustrating experience. I strongly advise against purchasing this product, as it does not meet the advertised quality.I recommend don't purchase from this seller.
"
1017,"
Good product spacious highly recommend it
"
1018,"
Nice 3 year completed
"
1019,"
First, To the many people who confused with the product genuine, this product is genuine. I have registered in wildcraft website also.Pros: spacious, fit for 17 inch laptop alsoCons: the bag material is too thin. I have been using wildcraft bags for long. I never seen this thin sheets.I will update the durability after using for some months.
"
1020,"
I have some damage pice
"
1021,"
First of all the wolf printed on it looks aggressive and awesome,quality avg but bag looks superb
"
1022,"
Quality is decent and it is spacious. Only problem is,  it doesn't have any valcro or zip for laptop sleeve and it is not cushioned also. There is large empty space after putting 15.6 inch laptop and it shakes the PC whenever you shake the bag.
"
1023,"
It‚Äôs nice and has compartments to put things it is light weight. It also looks good. But it would be good if it has more compartments.
"
1024,"
The biggest flaw of this bag is that it does not have even a slight bit of bottom padding. Don't buy if you wish to keep laptop or glass tiffin box in it. It's gonna break or get damage one day or the other.Otherwise you can use it, its quite spacious.
"
1025,"
The quality of the bag is excellent and received the same product as I ordered
"
1026,"
It's a great bag, but there is one problem. The material of the bag is not so much good and there no support for long bottles as other bags have.
"
1027,"
A one year honest review from a high school student is that its a great bag but the wolf is worn out after a year and a little bit of holes can be seen...

Writing this review after 3months of usage. Zip is of very bad quality. Wildcraft has reduced it's QUALITY and it's not waterproof/waterresistance. So don't waste your money on it.
"
1030,"
Look and feel wise bag is good. I chose the nylon one since it is supposed to be stronger. Looks like it will last.Am taking away 1 star because the bag is not as big as expected. It cannot hold a 17 inch laptop. The bag narrows towards the top,  that is possibly the reason. Need more volume statistics on the bags to buy the correct ones.
"
1031,"
This Bag can be used as a school bag. Not much big as I expected (44 liters). Quality is average but warranty is for 5 years (not expecting 5 year life).Don't have any cushion/pad protection for laptop, that's the main drawback.The handle (to hold a a suite case) is not good and is not cushioned.Overall I am not happy but just ok
"
1032,"
The bag is really spacious.I find it really fits all my needs.The bag is real light-weight.

I have been usung it for 3 months now.It has some signs of wear and tear but its fine. Doesn't get dirty very quickly and is very lightweight,Is very durable and has a lot of durability.It would be strongly recommend for school students for all classes unless they play bag fights and drag the bag all over stone. Has accessories pouch and is ok water proof for a water bottle fight but isn't tested in heavy showers.Design is fabulous and very cool and awesome. Overall The Bag Is a LEGEND and the best bag for a budget

water seeps in during rain. Compartment are not fully seperated so small object go pass from above chain to lower area through the gap.The graffiti black paint get removed very easily being wet and sunlight
"
1043,"
It has total 3 compartments out of which 2 are large you can easily carry a 15.6 inch laptop with 2 pairs of clothes easily. Look is decent wolf looks good and zips are good as well.It is good for 2-3 day trip in winter. The product is good but price is an issue.
"
1044,"
Very nice looks Wolf  design printed on Wildcraft bag (Black & Grey colour combination) as expected and shown in description. Light weight and latest design and good material used and stitched properly every corner of backpack. Comfortable in travelling, Also value for money.

Overall product is nice. It's super light and looks good only thing which i don't like is very very thin layer seperating the compartments, which actually helped it in weigh reduction. Rest fine.

The product was top-notch... It was lightweight, water resistant, had plenty of pockets.... and the product material was definitely good. But the only issue was I got the blue and white bag, and with only 2-3 days of use the white material was starting to come off or getting dirty, ad worst is the dirty part couldn't be cleaned with soap, alcohol, sanitizer, or anything else... However, it definitely looks cool üëçüèº

This item was purchased expecting a good American Tourister quality. The bag is light weight and spacious but is very flimsy and does not provide any back support. This bag should not be purchased as a laptop bag. Not sure if it will last long with extended usage.

White colour bag is good, but the print on the outside vanishes after regular use. So in my opinion one should opt for black one

After the use of 15 days bottel pocket got cut own of its own

Found is very useful and quality also good. But the side mesh pockets are of real bad quality. Both of them got torned within 2 months of usage. The mesh material could be better. Other than that the bad serves me we'll.

I'm thrilled to share my positive experience with the ""Half Moon Aztec 37L School Bag""! This backpack is a true winner for both students and professionals alike. The thoughtful design and spacious 37L capacity make it incredibly versatile, suitable for students in Class 5-12 and even college-goers. The inclusion of a dedicated 15.6 inch laptop compartment is a game-changer for individuals who need to carry their devices with them. The abundance of multiple pockets ensures that organization is a breeze ‚Äì I was able to neatly stow away everything from books to stationery and more. The Aztec design adds a stylish touch that appeals to both men and women. What truly sets this bag apart is its durability and comfort. The quality materials used in its construction give me confidence that it will withstand the rigors of daily use. The padded straps and back support make carrying the bag a comfortable experience, even during long commutes. In a nutshell, the Half Moon Aztec School Bag exceeds expectations with its functionality, style, and durability. Whether you're a student or a professional, this bag is a fantastic investment that seamlessly combines fashion and practicality.

The inclusion of a dedicated 15.6 inch laptop compartment is a game-changer for individuals who need to carry their devices with them. The abundance of multiple pockets ensures that organization is a breeze ‚Äì I was able to neatly stow away everything from books to stationery and more. The Aztec design adds a stylish touch that appeals to both men and women. What truly sets this bag apart is its durability and comfort. The quality materials used in its construction give me confidence that it will withstand the rigors of daily use. The padded straps and back support make carrying the bag a comfortable experience, even during long commutes. In a nutshell, the Half Moon Aztec School Bag exceeds expectations with its functionality, style, and durability. Whether you're a student or a professional, this bag is a fantastic investment that seamlessly combines fashion and practicality.

The product meets expectations and is exactly as shown in the picture on the website. The fabric is of good quality and looks pretty. I bought it for my cousin of grade 10. I was worried if the product would be smaller in size when I ordered it but surprisingly it's big enough for 10th grade students.

The bag isn't worth that amount. A thin parachute cloth used. Even light passes through it. The bag will not last much. It's totally a poorest quality bag and will not hold much weight of books. Fragile in cloth quality.

Was a bit sceptical before but the bag came out to be so pretty and cute. The badges and keychains were inside. I would say it could've been around 900 as it seems a bit expensive for the stitching and joints but still turned out too cute. Would highly recommend to give it a try!

This unisex backpack is perfect for anyone looking for a versatile and durable bag for school, work, travel, or everyday use.The 30L capacity of this backpack is ideal for carrying a 15.6-inch laptop, notebooks, textbooks, and other essentials. The water-resistant material is a great feature, providing peace of mind when traveling in unpredictable weather conditions. The backpack also has multiple compartments and pockets, making it easy to organize and access items quickly.I love the sleek and modern design of the TABELITO¬Æ NEO backpack. It is stylish enough for professional settings but also practical for students or travelers. The padded shoulder straps and back panel provide comfort even when carrying heavy loads, and the adjustable chest strap adds extra support.Overall, I highly recommend the TABELITO¬Æ NEO 30L Water Resistant Laptop Backpack for anyone in need of a versatile and reliable bag for daily use.

This bag is awesome! I don't generally write detailed reviews, but this item deserves it. The material quality is excellent. Its very very spacious. Enough space for any laptop. I have a 15.6"" lappy and it fit in without hassle. The padding on the back is placed intelligently and generously. The rain cover has good material and is sufficiently large to cover the entire bag. Its located at the bottom of the bag in a zipped compartment and can't be separated from the bag. I'm a bulky dude.

I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this bag. I purchased it with high hopes but was let down by its poor quality. Within a month of minimal usage, the bag began to tear and the seams started to come apart. The material used for the bag is extremely thin and cheap, which makes it prone to tearing. I did not expect the bag to fall apart so quickly, especially with minimal usage. I am very disappointed with my purchase and would not recommend this bag to anyone

Hi i am Hari. I bought the product 1 year ago. I heard of this brand's build quality from my sister. She own one variant bag like this. This bag us just awesome at this price range. The colour is just stunning, the build quality is just as expected. Its very useful not only for school purpose but also for travelling. I have bought this for both schooling and travelling. After buying this i have gone for a 3 day tour with all my things packed on it. I think this bag can almost contain things for a 5 day trip. Even all this weight, the build quality is never destructed. Never doubt the build quality if this bag. This bag carries weight as its is specified on the specs. Safe weight specified by the company is assured by the product. Thank You.If you find this useful, then click helpful button.

It's the best bag in Amazon and Flipkart ever. Many dresses comes on it like 3-4 jeans, 4-5 shirts, my cotton jacket, many more stuffs. I can say I kept alot of things in it and then also it took everything and it was comfortable and it was not heavy for me. This is the best bag ever to buy. I will surely say that you will love this bag. I don't think you will get better bag than this ever in this world. Just close your eyes and go for it. If your a school student or college student or you want to go for traveling you can take this bag and go anywhere in the world and you will love it. Just stop looking for any more bags and go for it...

Thou it has both pros and cons, All i can say is that the price is high for its quality.

The material used is very light. It can't even stand straight. So much so that it will bang when you place your bag with laptop on table. The main base has only outer layer nothing else. The mesh at the back side got brushed in normal usage within 3 weeks. If you are planning to buy an awesome looking plastic carry bag, go for it.

The bags material is a little cheap compared to the price it is good for tracking or office use but the compartments divider is so thin it can carry laptops but not books and other heavy luggage the zips quality is good its a good spacius bag many small compartments its not completely waste of money but the price is a little high the frontest small zip cant open fully because of the tightning system I saw many other lunar bags that are better than this one.It does not come like its shown in the picture the packaging is also very cheap it is only like a polythin transparent cover . Its not water proof

Quality is great, storage is awesome, so many pockets and the material is great. Shoulder straps are good and comfortable to carry.

Worth for the money

Product is good.  Enough space  good quality.  Just not waterproof
"
2394,"
Product looks good and stylish. Got a 48L one for short travels. However, I feel that the capacity is not that good.....looks more like a school bag. I wonder whether after putting my toiletry kit, will there be space enough for atleast 2 day of clothes. Anyway, will find out next time when I travel. Otherwise the product looks sturdy with enough padding to carry it without any problem. It also feels light and can withstand some rough use.
"
2395,"
Quality is low.
"
2396,"
It may have 48l but on comparison with 40l Aristocrat bag, we can understand the size difference ( I have purchased the Aristocrat bag for Rs 899/- offer) More over we can utilise the available space more effectively in Aristocrat rather than Lunars

Review of Skybags Backpack: Honest FeedbackI recently purchased a Skybags backpack, and while it has some positive aspects, there are a few quality issues that need addressing. Here‚Äôs my honest assessment:Pros:Design and Aesthetics: The backpack‚Äôs design is eye-catching, and I appreciate the overall look.Spacious: It offers ample space to carry my essentials, including a laptop and other belongings.Cons:Zip Quality: Unfortunately, one of the zippers is not properly stitched. This is a significant concern as zippers play a crucial role in securing our belongings.Strap Damage: I noticed damage on one of the straps. Durability is essential for a backpack, especially if you plan to use it regularly.Missing Skybags Tag: The absence of the Skybags tag on the inside raises doubts about its authenticity. All genuine Skybags backpacks should have this tag.Suggestions for Improvement:Quality Control: Skybags should pay closer attention to quality control during manufacturing. Properly stitched zippers and intact straps are essential for customer satisfaction.Authenticity Verification: Including the Skybags tag inside the backpack would reassure customers about its authenticity.

"
2458,"
Did not find skybag smaller than these online so bought this one ...it's gud but wud hv preferred a 2inch shorter bag in height. Also the division of the 2 bigger pockets is not equal because of which the books in front books fall in front unless jam packed.
"
2459,"
I think back portion quality should be better....
"
2460,"
The bag has an amazing and stylish look which I liked the most. The bag is spacious and can be used for school/college/traveling it also has good cushioning so no painful experience, the fabric used is durable also the zipper used is of great quality, it's also water resistant , the bag is also very light weight . The product is absolutely value for money.

Guys this is very good bag from Skybags. Good quality material used. Space is also good. No pocket organizer and no laptop compartment. But that is not a problem. Rain cover is available. Looks is so nice.i purchased it in Rs 701. I am fully satisfiedüôÇüôÇ

Good backpacks not only look great, they feel great! Padded handles, padded shoulder straps, and chest straps add that extra comfort and stability to ensure effortless trips
"
2476,"
No laptop compartment,no inside hidden pocket, only special feature is rain cover nothing else. Just a simple feature bag nothing extra. But skybag is skybag. Quality is at it's best. Chain is very smooth like butter. My last skybag was purchased 5.5 years ago. Old skybag is still great but facing chain issue and it's almost 5.5 years old. So I bought a new one. Skybag never compromise with quality.

The quality of Skybags backpacks has been wonderful for so long. Worth buying. Greatly satisfied with the product. Maybe the price would have been somewhat low, though it's a nice product compared to the other bags in this price range. If your budget is between 1000-1200, this bag is the best pick.

i don't recommend this bag at all, initially when i ordered this bag i thought it would perfect for college use but when i received it i was greatly disappointed cus as you can see in the above pictures it is of low quality  transparent fabric which would do nothing to protect your books if it gets soaked in the rain or gets any type of liquid spilled.

Quality of the adjuster is bad.Zip runner quality is okey.Can't use this bag for college and school. If you are going to use for small weight purpose go for it.My recommendation is do a extra stricts in local bag shop.My rating for this bag is. 6.3/10.

Looks exactly same as displayed. Stitching, material, zippers are of good quality. The bag doesn't bend even if it not not filled much, which keeps it straight and less bulky. Spacious even for small trips, laptops, and ideal for college use. School children might need a better space than this bag provides.Truly value for money!
"

size little big but product is good
"

The product came without any damage and in good condition. The bag is ideal for daily use. The compartments are convenient and the zippers in the bag were really good. A bag cover also came with this bag in its reseved compartment at the bottom compartment which is really useful and protective.
"
2716,"
It's a very good product but not light weight. Bag itself has his own weigh and inner space is very not much but comfortable for laptop. Safety of laptop üíª is priority and that is best in this bag. Hoping company will reduce some weight of the bag

Once chain was broken so I replaced and I got another bag. New bags zip broken in one month so will never recommend this brand it's just waste of money. I wish I could give zero star

This is worth buying.  good looks, good size as expected. Zips work smooth and well.  material is very good.  Haven't tested for water resistance though but looking at the material, it should be good as well.  The only thing is that i am still not sure if this is original Tommy Hilfiger or a brand replica..

Was skeptical before buying it and saw it was expensive in other sites and finally purchased it in Amazon.It holds good amount of weight and have carried it in flight and on multiple travels.

Awesome bag with stylish looks, decent quality, but not for daily rough use because it will get dirty very easily. Secondly I received a one year warranty card inside but amazon dint stamp on it which means I have to protect the invoice who print is already half gone.

The Bag is of really good quality, Zips are smooth, material is nice and waterproof. Laptop segment is well padded with extra Ipad/Tablet segment. Front zipper space is well organised for all kinds of small things like stationary,etc. The bag looks premium with a price tag of 3300-3700 on other e-commerce sites like Myntra. Easily recommmendable.

I just loved the bag so much that i bought a 2nd one in the same range. I first had a navy blue and turquoise zipper combo backpack. Used it for almost a year and a half. That bag was so sturdy. No tear only one zipper was not working well. Otherwise I still use it occasionally. That's how much this bag is good. I'll just attach the old bag also besides the new bag.  Just go for it...!!!!Ahh the only thing that disappointed me is brand name is printed in the new bag whereas the old bag have been embroidered with it..

Colour, design and cloth material, stitching are good, and also very light weight...But main two cons are -1) its not waterproof, inner side gets wet while medium rain falls on it.2) side pocket of water bottle is so small in length that bottles slips down, falls down easyly.

Bag quality is not sturdy and the straps will break if used for heavy weight. Shoulder strap is not comfortable. This bag's worth should be between 300 - 500 max
"
2909,"
Zipper s are so smooth

My daughter has been using a same backpack of different colour for the last one and half years for going to School and it is still in good condition. Her School books weigh nearly 10 kgs. That's why I purchased another.
"
2913,"
Writing this review after using it for one and a half year.. Everything is good except the zips, they start giving problem after few months of usage.
"
2914,"
Had been a great bag for a long time(approx.. 1.5 years) zips gave up after 1 year or so.Recommend to not wash or zips might give in
"
2915,"
I bought it yestday on 21st February 23. One thing i liked about this bag is good space n smooth zippers. I really appreciate the makers of this bag. it's comfortable n good design.worth to buy
"
2916,"
In terms of look product is good and weight also light. It's a 35 litter bag but looks bit small.overall good product.

The bag is very nice and light weight and one disappointed inner side not provide zip type compartment ü§® other wise bag looking is good
"
2923,"
The bag is good in looks and have many compartments but not good for the back.its not comfortable to carry heavy books or laptop or items.

Nice quality
"
2925,"
Everything is good, but the shoulder strap should have been stitched better, look at it how Skybags does the stitches
"
2926,"
Best bag.. long lasting...
"
2927,"
Good product definitely 4-10 years it will not get damage
"
2928,"
Huge space for the school books...and good quality...
"
2929,"
Bag stitchings are wrost, please don't buy it, with same price there are goods bags available, like skybag.
"

It's so cool,I love this bag . This bag is so comfortable for school students üòÄ.It has so many partition and has 2 long zip.üòÉ

It was ok ok type of quality not that great I was expecting little more on the inner layer quality
"

This product is really good one and the details which has been given in portal is true.....
"
2940,"
The quality is superb and I find it really easy to carry it anywhere I want
"
2941,"
I haven't used this much now. Will give reviews afterwards.
"
2942,"
After using 6-7 months,the material gets torn from some side , its a genuine review
"
2943,"
The discount price is worth for the bag not the actual MRP. The bag is sturdy and good with no damage.
"
2944,"
As per price material is okay, I wish it could be more qulity material used at this price but it is like 500-600 rs bags
"
2945,"
It doesn't have premium looks but for it's price it is the best. You can put a lot of stuff into this bag. It has four compartments. Very useful for short trips. Yes its water resistant but can take up mild rains not the heavy ones.
"
2946,"
‚òπÔ∏è I purchased the bag on December 2021, I used it for my office use only but it did't last for too long. It started complains in many parts of the bag ( Zip, stitching...) and at last at December 2022 it was useless üò™ I got correct 1 year use of bag.But the other bag I purchased from decathlon at the year 2017 is still in perfect condition, the main highlight is that both don't have a big price difference.
"
2947,"
Very good product
"
2948,"
it is comparatively smaller than my previous bag so trying to get used to it it hangs a lot which I don't like i mean air get too much filled and seems too baggy , but overall i will say it's a decent bag
"
2949,"
I like it to much I can carry it any where it is very use full
"
2950,"
Zips are in medium quality
"
2951,"
Worth the price
"
2952,"
I wanted a bag with larger space. It has enogh space. Giving 4stars as I have not used it that much for traveling with much weight. Chains are good and good for college students and to carry things like laptop and enough books(thick books). Strap quality and material is good too. But it could be a little cheaper!
"
2953,"
Product quality is good in every feature
"
2954,"
Bag size is small.. However nice
"

"
2961,"
Don't buy products from this company.Worst chains in bag and if you try to claim warranty they will ask you to post bag to theirs address it will take atleast month.Honestly go for some good brand bags this one doesn't deserve to be bought.
"
2962,"
High price
"
2963,"
Comfortable for traveling and very useful... But quality not upto the mark... Please improve qualityand provide rain coat under the bag...

One of my Zippers came off only on the 2nd day of purchase. Product looks sturdy and usable for the money spent but the zippers should have been better. have to take care while pulling them, Otherwise good purchase for the money.
"
2968,"
The quality of the bag is very good, thanks to amazon that provided me such a bag, it is a good bag for school college and travelling.
"
2969,"
Quality is low

"
2972,"
Before purchasing this bag, I found the number of bags from different companies, but in the end, I selected this product. Overall experience was good, and the material was also worth it.
"
2973,"
The bag is easy to carry but the strap given to hold the water bottle and the compartment given to keep the stationary items are low-quality stitches. They are tearing apart automatically.
"
2974,"
For a laptop bag, it is too thin. Quality of fabric and the stitching is definitely not worth your money.I wish somebody wrote an honest review before I bought it.
"
2975,"
I highly recommend the Safari Omega 30L Laptop Backpack! This bag is perfect for students like me, travelers, and professionals . Not only does it comfortably fit a laptop, but it also has ample storage space for all your other essentials. The added rain cover is a great bonus, as it ensures the safety of your belongings during unexpected weather. The sleek design and black color make it a versatile option for any occasion. Overall, a great investment for those looking for a durable and functional backpack. 5 stars!
"
2976,"
I like this bag...but please check before packing...they delivered damaged rain cover with my bag.
"

"

It's a good bag for the price but the finishing and stitching should be checked twice before using it. The vendor has to do proper QC before sending it to the customer.

The quality of material is very thin. The stitching also is not up to the mark. Stitching on the handle got loose within 2-3 weeks of purchase. The mesh/ net kind of thing on the backside and on the lower portion of handle is quite rough and cause itching whenever it comes in contact with the skin.
"
